# Covid-19 Data Analysis üíÄ‚ö†Ô∏è
The EDA project on COVID-19 aims to analyze and visualize various aspects of the pandemic in India, including the spread of the virus, vaccination progress, and forecasting future trends.

Data Collection: The project utilizes two datasets: one containing COVID-19 case data (covid_19_india.csv) and another containing vaccination data (covid_vaccine_statewise.csv).

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The COVID-19 case data is cleaned by removing unnecessary columns and formatting dates. Similarly, the vaccination data is preprocessed to handle missing values and rename columns for clarity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The EDA phase involves analyzing various aspects of the pandemic, such as total confirmed cases, deaths, and active cases over time. Additionally, it explores the vaccination progress across different states, genders, and age groups.

Time Series Forecasting: The project employs time series forecasting techniques, specifically ARIMA modeling, to predict future trends in COVID-19 cases for a specific state (Maharashtra). The ARIMA model is fitted to historical data and used to forecast daily confirmed cases for the next 30 days.

Visualization and Insights: Throughout the project, visualizations are created using libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. These visualizations provide insights into the spread of the virus, vaccination trends, and forecasted future scenarios.

Summary and Conclusions: The project concludes with a summary of findings, highlighting key insights and observations from the data analysis. It also discusses the limitations of the analysis and potential areas for further exploration.

Overall, the EDA project on COVID-19 provides a comprehensive analysis of the pandemic's impact in India, leveraging data-driven approaches to understand trends, make predictions, and inform decision-making.
